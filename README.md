# Project Overview

This is the 5th project on the Udacity FEND track. This projects is about testing the web-based app that reeds RSS feeds and provides them as a list to display on the page. Tests are made in several suites, each of which checks for a certain element functionality. Some of the test are asynchronous and check for different states of the app.

## Why this Project?

Testing is an important part of the development process and many organizations practice a standard of development known as "test-driven development". This is when developers write tests first, before they ever start developing their application. All the tests initially fail and then they start writing application code to make these tests pass.

Whether you work in an organization that uses test-driven development or in an organization that uses tests to make sure future feature development doesn't break existing features, it's an important skill to have!

## What I learned?

I learned how to use Jasmine to write a number of tests against a pre-existing application. These test covered the underlying business logic of the application as well as the event handling and DOM manipulations.

## Why are tests important?

- Writing effective tests requires analyzing multiple aspects of an application including the HTML, CSS and JavaScript - an extremely important skill when changing teams or joining a new company.

- Good tests give you the ability to quickly analyze whether new code breaks an existing feature within your codebase, without having to manually test all of the functionality.

# Try the Project for yourself

1.  Clone/fork the project from https://github.com/EvanMatveev/frontend-nanodegree-feedreader.git
2.  Once downloaded, open index.html file in the browser to see all tests results
3.  To see the code for the tests open feedreader.js in the 'jasmine/spec' folder
4.  To look at the application logic open app.js contained in the 'js' folder
5.  Try tweaking the code or adding new tests to the feedreader file
